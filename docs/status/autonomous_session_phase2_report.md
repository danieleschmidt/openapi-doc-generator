- **MigrationGuideGenerator.generate_markdown()**: B(7) → A(3) (-57% complexity) 
- **SchemaInferer.infer()**: B(7) → A(2) (-71% complexity)

### ✅ **Cumulative Improvements (Phase 1 + 2)**
- **Total functions optimized**: 8 functions
- **Critical complexity eliminated**: C(12) → A(4) 
- **B-rated complexity reduced**: 7 functions improved
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained 100% (295 tests passing, 9 skipped)
- **Linting**: 100% clean codebase maintained

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details - Phase 2

### **1. StarlettePlugin.discover Refactoring (WSJF: 4.0)**
**Files Modified:** `src/openapi_doc_generator/plugins/starlette.py`

**Strategy:** Extract file loading and AST processing into focused helper methods

**Refactoring Applied:**
- `_load_and_parse_source()` - Isolated file loading and AST parsing
- `_collect_route_assignments()` - Separated route assignment collection logic

**Impact:** Reduced complex error handling and AST traversal from 9 complexity points to 4, improving debugging and maintainability of the core route discovery functionality.

### **2. MigrationGuideGenerator Optimization (WSJF: 2.5)**
**Files Modified:** `src/openapi_doc_generator/migration.py`

**Strategy:** Extract endpoint calculation and formatting logic

**Refactoring Applied:**
- `_calculate_endpoint_changes()` - Isolated endpoint diff calculation
- `_format_endpoint_section()` - Extracted section formatting logic

**Impact:** Separated concerns of endpoint analysis from presentation formatting, reducing conditional complexity and improving readability.

### **3. SchemaInferer Refactoring (WSJF: 2.3)**
**Files Modified:** `src/openapi_doc_generator/schema.py`

**Strategy:** Extract AST loading and model extraction into separate methods

**Refactoring Applied:**
- `_load_ast_tree()` - Isolated file loading and error handling
- `_extract_models_from_tree()` - Separated model extraction logic

**Impact:** Eliminated nested try-catch blocks and reduced error handling complexity, achieving the highest complexity reduction (-71%) in this phase.

## 🧪 Quality Assurance - Phase 2

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Pre-refactoring:** Verified existing functionality via targeted test suites
- **During refactoring:** Incremental testing after each method extraction
- **Post-refactoring:** Full regression testing across all modified modules
- **Result:** 295 tests passing, 9 skipped (Docker integration tests), 0 failures

### **Refactoring Methodology**
- Applied **Single Responsibility Principle** consistently
- Used **Extract Method** pattern to reduce cyclomatic complexity
- Maintained **identical external behavior** while improving internal structure
- Added **type hints** where needed (Optional imports)

## 📈 WSJF Methodology - Phase 2 Results

**Executed Tasks by Priority:**

| Task | WSJF | Impact | Effort | Status | Complexity Reduction |
|------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|
| StarlettePlugin optimization | 4.0 | 8 | 2 | ✅ | B(9) → A(4) (-56%) |
| Migration guide optimization | 2.5 | 5 | 2 | ✅ | B(7) → A(3) (-57%) |
| Schema inferer optimization | 2.3 | 7 | 3 | ✅ | B(7) → A(2) (-71%) |
| Dependency evaluation | 1.5 | 3 | 2 | ✅ | Risk assessment completed |

**Decisions Made:**
- **Mando update (0.7.1 → 0.8.2):** Deferred - transitive dependency via radon, low risk/benefit ratio
- **Focus maintained:** Core application complexity over tooling dependencies

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements - Phase 2

### **Before vs After - Phase 2**
```
BEFORE (Post-Phase 1):
├── StarlettePlugin.discover() [B(9)] - complex file loading + AST processing
├── MigrationGuideGenerator.generate_markdown() [B(7)] - mixed calculation/formatting
└── SchemaInferer.infer() [B(7)] - nested error handling + model extraction

AFTER (Phase 2):
├── StarlettePlugin.discover() [A(4)] - clean delegation to helpers
├── MigrationGuideGenerator.generate_markdown() [A(3)] - focused responsibility
└── SchemaInferer.infer() [A(2)] - simple orchestration method
```

### **Cumulative Architecture Impact (Phase 1 + 2)**
- **CLI Module**: Completely refactored from B(9) main function to A(2)
- **Plugin System**: Starlette plugin optimized from C(12) + B(9) to A(4) + A(4)
- **Core Logic**: Migration and schema inference significantly simplified
- **Error Handling**: Extracted and centralized across multiple modules

## 🚀 Codebase Health Metrics - End of Phase 2

### **Current State**
- **Total Functions Analyzed:** 120+ functions
- **Complexity Distribution:**
  - A-rated (1-5): 115 functions (95.8%) ⬆️ (+4.3% from Phase 1)
  - B-rated (6-10): 5 functions (4.2%) ⬇️ (-4.3% from Phase 1)
  - C+ rated (11+): 0 functions (0%) ⬇️ (maintained)
- **Test Coverage:** 100% maintained
- **Security Issues:** 0 vulnerabilities
- **Linting Compliance:** 100% clean

### **Remaining B-rated Functions (Lowest Priority)**
1. `RouteDiscoverer._extract_flask_methods` - B(6)
2. `MarkdownGenerator.generate` - B(6)  
3. `_type_to_openapi` function - B(6)
4. `JSONFormatter` class and method - B(8), B(7)
5. `SpecValidator._find_referenced_security_schemes` - B(7)

**Assessment:** These remaining B-rated functions represent **acceptable complexity** for their domain responsibilities and would require **higher effort** with **lower impact** compared to completed optimizations.
