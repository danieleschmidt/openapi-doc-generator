**Session Focus:** Route Performance Metrics Implementation (WSJF: 1.4)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Test Coverage:** Enhanced to 154 tests (added 11 new performance metrics tests)

---

## 🎯 Session Objectives

Implement comprehensive performance monitoring for the OpenAPI Documentation Generator to provide detailed observability into route discovery operations, including:
- High-precision timing measurement for all key operations
- Memory usage tracking and optimization insights
- Performance aggregation and statistical analysis
- Integration with existing JSON logging infrastructure
- CLI option for optional performance metrics collection

## 📊 Implementation Summary

### Core Components Delivered

#### 1. **Performance Measurement Decorator** (`utils.py`)
```python
@measure_performance("operation_name")
def my_function():
    # Function execution is automatically timed and logged
    pass
```

**Key Features:**
- High-precision timing using `time.perf_counter()`
- Memory usage tracking with `tracemalloc`
- Automatic aggregated statistics collection
- Integration with correlation ID system
- Exception-safe measurement (logs performance even on errors)

#### 2. **Route Discovery Performance Integration** (`discovery.py`)
```python
@measure_performance("route_discovery")
def _discover_routes():
    # Route discovery timing and memory tracking
    routes = discover_framework_routes(source)
    logger.info(f"Discovered {len(routes)} routes", extra={
        'route_count': len(routes),
        'framework': framework
    })
    return routes
```

**Tracked Operations:**
- `route_discovery`: End-to-end route discovery timing
- `framework_detection`: Framework identification performance
- `ast_cache`: AST parsing cache hit/miss rates

#### 3. **CLI Integration** (`cli.py`)
```bash
# New CLI option
--performance-metrics    Enable detailed performance metrics collection and logging
```

**Performance Summary Output:**
```json
{"timestamp":"2025-07-22T00:56:55Z","level":"INFO","logger":"openapi_doc_generator.utils","message":"Performance Summary:","correlation_id":"d04bfed0","performance_stats":{"route_discovery":{"count":1,"total_duration_ms":1.52,"avg_duration_ms":1.52}}}
```

#### 4. **AST Cache Performance Monitoring** (`utils.py`)
```python
# Enhanced AST cache with performance logging
logger.debug("AST cache hit for example.py", extra={
    'operation': 'ast_cache',
    'cache_hit': True,
    'source_file': 'example.py',
    'cache_size': 5,
    'hit_rate': 0.85
})
```

#### 5. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`tests/test_performance_metrics.py`)
- **11 comprehensive tests covering:**
  - Execution time measurement accuracy
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Exception handling during measurement
  - Route discovery performance integration
  - AST cache performance metrics
  - JSON logging format compatibility
  - Framework detection performance
  - Performance metrics aggregation
  - Enable/disable functionality
  - Memory tracking accuracy validation
  - Correlation ID consistency

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Performance Measurement Architecture
- **Decorator Pattern:** Clean, non-intrusive performance measurement
- **Optional Tracking:** Performance metrics disabled by default, enabled via CLI
- **Memory Safety:** Exception-safe measurement that doesn't affect normal operation
- **High Precision:** Uses `time.perf_counter()` for microsecond-level accuracy

#### Statistics Aggregation
```python
{
    "operation_name": {
        "count": 5,
        "total_duration_ms": 125.43,
        "avg_duration_ms": 25.09,
        "min_duration_ms": 22.1,
        "max_duration_ms": 28.7
    }
}
```

#### Integration Points
- **JSON Logging:** Seamless integration with existing structured logging
- **Correlation IDs:** All performance metrics share session correlation IDs
- **CLI Options:** New `--performance-metrics` flag for opt-in collection
- **Error Handling:** Performance measurement continues even when operations fail
