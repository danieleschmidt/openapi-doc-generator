# Compliance Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the compliance framework for the OpenAPI Doc Generator project, ensuring adherence to industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Compliance Standards

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10** - Web application security risks
- **CWE Top 25** - Common software weaknesses
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Comprehensive security guidance

### Development Standards
- **SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts)** - Software supply chain security
- **SPDX** - Software Package Data Exchange for license compliance
- **SBOM** - Software Bill of Materials for transparency

### Industry Standards
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management
- **SOC 2 Type 2** - Service organization controls
- **GDPR** - General Data Protection Regulation (where applicable)

## Automated Compliance Checks

### Pre-commit Validation
```bash
# Security scanning
bandit -r src/ -f json -o bandit-report.json
safety check --json --output safety-report.json
detect-secrets scan --all-files

# License compliance
pip-licenses --format=json --output-file=licenses.json

# Code quality
ruff check src/
mypy src/
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Compliance
```yaml
# Automated compliance validation in GitHub Actions
- name: Compliance Check
  run: |
    python scripts/compliance_check.py
    python scripts/generate_compliance_report.py
```

### Dependency Compliance
- All dependencies must have compatible licenses
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed within 30 days
- Regular dependency updates through Dependabot

## Compliance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- Security vulnerability count and resolution time
- License compliance status
- Code coverage percentage (minimum 80%)
- SBOM generation and accuracy
- Pre-commit hook compliance rate

### Reporting Schedule
- **Daily**: Automated security scans
- **Weekly**: Compliance dashboard updates
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive compliance reports
- **Quarterly**: Compliance framework review

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk Level | Security | Dependencies | Code Quality | Documentation |
|------------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **High**   | Critical vulnerabilities | Incompatible licenses | <70% coverage | Missing critical docs |
| **Medium** | Medium vulnerabilities | Outdated packages | 70-80% coverage | Incomplete docs |
| **Low**    | Low vulnerabilities | Current packages | >80% coverage | Complete docs |

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Automated scanning** prevents high-risk issues
2. **Staged deployments** limit blast radius
3. **Regular audits** ensure ongoing compliance
4. **Documentation requirements** maintain transparency

## Audit Trail

### Evidence Collection
- All CI/CD pipeline runs logged and archived
- Security scan results stored with timestamps
- Dependency updates tracked with approval records
- Code review records maintained

### Retention Policy
- Security logs: 2 years
- Build artifacts: 1 year
- Compliance reports: 3 years
- Audit evidence: 5 years

## Compliance Roles and Responsibilities

### Development Team
- Implement secure coding practices
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Address security findings within SLA
- Document architectural decisions

### Security Team
- Review security scan results
- Approve dependency updates
- Conduct periodic security assessments
- Maintain security policies

### Compliance Officer
- Generate compliance reports
- Coordinate external audits
- Track remediation progress
- Update compliance requirements

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Short-term**: Assess impact and implement fixes
3. **Long-term**: Review and improve security measures

### Compliance Violation Response
1. **Identify**: Root cause analysis
2. **Remediate**: Implement corrective measures
3. **Prevent**: Update processes to prevent recurrence
4. **Report**: Document incident and response

## Tools Integration

### Compliance Automation Tools
```python
# compliance_tools.py
COMPLIANCE_TOOLS = {
    "security": ["bandit", "safety", "pip-audit"],
    "licenses": ["pip-licenses", "licensee"],
    "quality": ["ruff", "mypy", "coverage"],
    "supply_chain": ["cyclonedx-bom", "syft"]
}
```

### Dashboard Integration
- Security findings aggregated in centralized dashboard
- Compliance metrics tracked over time
- Automated alerting for policy violations
- Integration with incident management systems

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review compliance metrics and trends
- **Quarterly**: Update compliance requirements
- **Annually**: Comprehensive framework assessment

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Developer feedback on compliance process efficiency
- Security team input on tool effectiveness
- External audit recommendations incorporation

## Training and Awareness

### Required Training
- Secure coding practices for all developers
- Compliance framework overview for team leads
- Incident response procedures for security team
