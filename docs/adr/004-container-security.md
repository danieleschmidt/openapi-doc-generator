# ADR-004: Container Security Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The OpenAPI Doc Generator is distributed as Docker images and used in CI/CD pipelines, making container security critical for:

1. **Supply Chain Security**: Ensuring trusted, minimal attack surface
2. **Runtime Security**: Safe execution in production environments
3. **Compliance**: Meeting enterprise security requirements
4. **Vulnerability Management**: Automated scanning and remediation

Container environments present unique security challenges including privilege escalation, secret exposure, and supply chain attacks.

## Decision
Implement comprehensive container security strategy with:

1. **Multi-Stage Builds**: Minimize final image size and attack surface
2. **Non-Root User**: Run as UID 1000 with minimal privileges
3. **Minimal Base Images**: Use distroless or Alpine-based images
4. **Security Scanning**: Integrated Trivy scanning in CI/CD pipeline
5. **Health Checks**: Built-in health endpoints for monitoring
6. **Secret Management**: No secrets in images, runtime injection only
7. **Read-Only Filesystem**: Container runs with read-only root filesystem
8. **Capability Dropping**: Remove unnecessary Linux capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Significantly reduced attack surface
- Compliance with security best practices
- Automated vulnerability detection and remediation
- Safe for enterprise deployment
- Better operational security posture

### Negative
- Increased build complexity and time
- Additional CI/CD pipeline steps
- Potential compatibility issues with read-only filesystem
- Learning curve for security configurations

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic Security Only**: Simple non-root user
   - Rejected: Insufficient for enterprise requirements

2. **Full Security Hardening**: All possible security measures
   - Rejected: Complexity outweighs benefits for current use case

3. **External Security Tools**: Rely on external scanning only
   - Rejected: Lacks integration with development workflow
