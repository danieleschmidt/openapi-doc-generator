# Code Review

## Engineer Review
- `ruff check .` found no issues.
- `bandit -r src` reported no security concerns.
- `pytest -q` passed with 10 tests.
- `python -m timeit` on `echo()` averaged around 38ns per call, showing trivial overhead.

## Product Manager Review
- Features implemented align with Phase 1 tasks in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, providing route discovery, schema inference, OpenAPI spec generation, markdown docs, and a CLI.
- All acceptance criteria in `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json` are satisfied.

All checks passed and the feature behaves as expected.
