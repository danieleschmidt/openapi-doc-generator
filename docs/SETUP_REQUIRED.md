# Manual Setup Requirements

## Overview

This document lists items that require manual setup due to permission limitations in automated processes.

## GitHub Repository Settings

### Branch Protection Rules
- Enable branch protection for `main` branch
- Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Reference: [Branch Protection Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches)

### Repository Topics and Settings
- Add relevant topics (e.g., `python`, `openapi`, `documentation`, `code-generation`)
- Set repository description and homepage URL
- Enable issue templates and discussions

### GitHub Actions Workflows
Create the following workflow files in `.github/workflows/`:

1. **ci.yml** - Continuous integration pipeline
2. **release.yml** - Automated releases and PyPI publishing  
3. **security.yml** - Security scanning and dependency updates
4. **docs.yml** - Documentation generation and deployment

## External Integrations

### Code Quality Services
- **Codecov**: Code coverage reporting integration
- **Sonar**: Code quality and security analysis
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Monitoring and Observability
- Configure application monitoring (if applicable)
- Set up error tracking and logging aggregation
- Implement performance monitoring

## Security Configuration

### Repository Secrets
Add the following secrets in repository settings:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - For automated package publishing
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For coverage reporting
- Additional service tokens as needed

### Security Features
- Enable Dependabot alerts and security updates
- Configure CodeQL scanning for vulnerability detection
- Enable secret scanning to prevent credential leaks

## Manual Review Required

These items require careful review and manual configuration:
1. Production deployment settings
2. External service integrations
3. Security policy configuration
4. Release automation workflows
