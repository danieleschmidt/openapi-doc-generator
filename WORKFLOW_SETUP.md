# GitHub Workflows Setup Guide

## Overview

Due to GitHub App permission restrictions, the following GitHub Actions workflow files need to be added manually by a repository administrator with `workflows` permission.

## Required Workflow Files

The following 6 workflow files are ready and need to be added to `.github/workflows/`:

### 1. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning with Bandit, Safety, CodeQL, and Trivy
- **Triggers**: Push, PR, and daily schedule
- **Features**: SARIF uploads, vulnerability reporting, container scanning

### 2. Release Automation (`release.yml`) 
- **Purpose**: Automated releases with Docker images and PyPI publishing
- **Triggers**: Version tags and manual dispatch
- **Features**: Multi-arch Docker builds, GitHub releases, PyPI publishing

### 3. Performance Testing (`performance.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Performance benchmarking and regression detection
- **Triggers**: Push, PR, and weekly schedule
- **Features**: Benchmark comparisons, load testing, performance reports

### 4. Dependency Updates (`dependency-update.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated dependency management and security updates
- **Triggers**: Weekly schedule and manual dispatch
- **Features**: Security-prioritized updates, auto-merge for safe updates

### 5. Semantic Release (`semantic-release.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated versioning based on conventional commits
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch
- **Features**: Semantic versioning, changelog generation, automated releases

### 6. Repository Maintenance (`maintenance.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated repository cleanup and health monitoring
- **Triggers**: Weekly schedule
- **Features**: Artifact cleanup, branch management, security audits, issue triage

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Repository Permissions
Ensure the following permissions are enabled:
- `actions: write`
- `contents: write` 
- `security-events: write`
- `packages: write`
- `issues: write`
- `pull-requests: write`

### Step 2: Required Secrets
Add the following secrets to the repository:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For automated PyPI publishing
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: For Docker Hub integration (optional)
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: For Docker Hub integration (optional)

### Step 3: Add Workflow Files
Copy the backed-up workflow files from the development environment to `.github/workflows/`:

```bash
# The workflow files are available in the Claude Code session
# They need to be manually added to .github/workflows/ by a repository admin
```

## Workflow File Locations

The complete workflow files are available and include:

1. **`.github/workflows/security.yml`** - Security scanning automation
2. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Release and publishing automation  
3. **`.github/workflows/performance.yml`** - Performance testing automation
4. **`.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml`** - Dependency management
5. **`.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml`** - Semantic release automation
6. **`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`** - Repository maintenance automation

## Additional Configurations

The following configuration files are already in place:
- **`.releaserc.json`** - Semantic release configuration
- **`scripts/update_version.py`** - Version update automation script

## Validation

After adding the workflows, verify they are working by:

1. **Check Actions Tab**: Verify workflows appear in GitHub Actions
2. **Test Security Scan**: Push a commit to trigger security scanning
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure all required permissions are granted
4. **Review Outputs**: Check that workflows complete successfully

## Benefits After Setup

Once workflows are active, the repository will have:
- ✅ **Automated Security Scanning**: Daily vulnerability assessments
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance regression detection  
- ✅ **Automated Releases**: Semantic versioning with Docker and PyPI publishing
- ✅ **Dependency Management**: Automated security updates
- ✅ **Repository Maintenance**: Self-cleaning and health monitoring
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation

## Support

For questions about workflow setup:
- Review individual workflow files for detailed configuration
- Check GitHub Actions documentation for troubleshooting
- Ensure all required secrets and permissions are configured

**Note**: These workflows represent enterprise-grade CI/CD automation that will significantly enhance the project's reliability, security, and maintainability.
