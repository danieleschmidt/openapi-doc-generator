# Project Charter: OpenAPI-Doc-Generator

## Project Overview

**Vision**: Automate the creation of comprehensive API documentation from code analysis across multiple frameworks and languages.

**Mission**: Provide developers with a seamless tool that discovers routes, infers schemas, and generates production-ready API documentation including OpenAPI specs, interactive playgrounds, and markdown guides.

## Problem Statement

Developers waste significant time manually maintaining API documentation that quickly becomes outdated. Existing tools lack cross-framework support and fail to provide comprehensive documentation automation with schema inference and test generation capabilities.

## Solution Approach

OpenAPI-Doc-Generator addresses this through:
- Automatic route discovery across popular Python and JavaScript frameworks
- Intelligent schema inference from code annotations and data models
- Multi-format output generation (OpenAPI, Markdown, HTML playgrounds)
- Automated test suite generation for API validation
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Framework Coverage**: Support for FastAPI, Express, Flask, Django, Tornado, GraphQL
2. **Documentation Quality**: Generate accurate, comprehensive API documentation
3. **Developer Experience**: CLI tool that integrates seamlessly into development workflows
4. **Performance**: Sub-second analysis for typical applications
5. **Reliability**: 95%+ accuracy in route discovery and schema inference

### Key Performance Indicators
- Time reduction in documentation maintenance (target: 80% reduction)
- Developer adoption rate within target organizations
- Documentation accuracy compared to manually maintained docs
- CI/CD integration success rate

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope
- Python web frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django, Tornado)
- JavaScript/Node.js frameworks (Express)
- GraphQL schema introspection
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification generation
- Interactive documentation playgrounds
- Automated test generation
- Performance monitoring
- Docker containerization

### Out of Scope
- Real-time API monitoring
- API gateway functionality
- Authentication implementation
- Database schema generation
- Non-web service documentation

## Stakeholder Alignment

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Development Teams**: Primary users requiring automated documentation
- **DevOps Engineers**: Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- **API Consumers**: Users of generated documentation and playgrounds
- **Project Maintainers**: Long-term sustainability and feature development

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Framework Communities**: Compatibility and plugin ecosystem
- **Enterprise Users**: Security, compliance, and enterprise features
- **Open Source Contributors**: Community-driven enhancements

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Framework Evolution**: Breaking changes in supported frameworks
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive test coverage, plugin architecture
