# ADR-003: Integrated Performance Monitoring

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The OpenAPI Doc Generator processes complex codebases and performs intensive AST parsing, route discovery, and documentation generation. As the tool scales to larger applications, understanding performance characteristics becomes critical for:

1. **User Experience**: Long processing times impact developer adoption
2. **Resource Optimization**: Memory and CPU usage patterns need monitoring
3. **Debugging**: Performance bottlenecks must be identifiable
4. **Operational Metrics**: Production deployments need monitoring capabilities

Current implementation lacks comprehensive performance visibility, making it difficult to optimize processing for large codebases or identify regression in performance.

## Decision
Implement integrated performance monitoring with the following components:

1. **Timing Instrumentation**: Measure duration of key operations (framework detection, route discovery, AST parsing, document generation)
2. **Memory Tracking**: Monitor memory allocation patterns and peak usage
3. **Cache Metrics**: Track AST cache hit rates and effectiveness
4. **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted performance logs with correlation IDs
5. **CLI Integration**: Optional --performance-metrics flag for detailed output
6. **Operation Correlation**: Track performance across the entire processing pipeline

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enables data-driven performance optimization
- Provides debugging capabilities for slow processing
- Supports operational monitoring in production environments
- Helps identify performance regressions in CI/CD
- Improves user experience through transparency

### Negative
- Adds slight overhead to all operations (estimated <2% impact)
- Increases complexity of logging and instrumentation code
- Requires additional testing for performance measurement accuracy
- May expose sensitive timing information in logs

## Alternatives Considered

1. **External Profiling Only**: Using external tools like cProfile
   - Rejected: Lacks integration with business logic, harder for end users

2. **Basic Timing Only**: Simple start/end timestamps
   - Rejected: Insufficient granularity for optimization decisions

3. **Sampling-Based Monitoring**: Collect metrics for subset of operations
   - Rejected: May miss critical performance issues
