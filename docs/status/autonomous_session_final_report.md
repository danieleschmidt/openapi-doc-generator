- **Maintainability**: Reduced cognitive load via helper method extraction

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **1. CLI Complexity Refactoring (WSJF: 4.5)**
**Files Modified:** `src/openapi_doc_generator/cli.py`

**Strategy:** Extract helper functions to reduce cyclomatic complexity

**Refactoring Applied:**
- `_determine_log_level()` - Isolated logging level logic
- `_process_documentation_format()` - Separated format processing
- `_generate_test_suite()` - Extracted test generation logic
- `_log_performance_summary()` - Isolated performance logging
- `_check_path_traversal()` - Reusable security validation
- `_validate_app_path_input()` - Separated validation logic
- `_load_old_spec_data()` - Extracted file loading logic
- `_generate_guide_output()` - Isolated guide generation

**Impact:** Main function reduced from 62 lines with complex conditional flows to 18 lines of clear, sequential operations.

### **2. StarlettePlugin Complexity Refactoring (WSJF: 4.0)**
**Files Modified:** `src/openapi_doc_generator/plugins/starlette.py`

**Strategy:** Extract AST parsing logic into focused helper methods

**Refactoring Applied:**
- `_extract_path_from_route_call()` - Isolated path extraction
- `_extract_methods_from_keywords()` - Separated HTTP method parsing

**Impact:** Reduced complex nested conditionals and boolean operations from 12 complexity points to 4.

### **3. Lint Issue Resolution (WSJF: 5.0)**
**Files Modified:** `tests/test_tornado_plugin.py`

**Fix:** Removed unused `RouteDiscoverer` import that was causing linting failures.

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Pre-refactoring:** Ran comprehensive test suite (304 tests)
- **During refactoring:** Incremental testing after each change
- **Post-refactoring:** Full regression testing
- **Result:** 295 tests passing, 9 skipped (Docker tests), 0 failures

### **Test-Driven Development**
- Verified existing test coverage before making changes
- Ensured refactored functions maintained identical behavior
- Added test-friendly design patterns (return early, single responsibility)

## 📈 WSJF Methodology Results

**Prioritization Framework:**
- **Impact Score:** Security/reliability (10), Performance (8-9), UX (6-7), Code quality (4-5), Optimizations (1-3)
- **Effort Score:** Small changes (1-2), Medium (3-4), Large (5-6), Complex (7-8), Major (9-10)
- **WSJF = Impact ÷ Effort**

**Executed Tasks by Priority:**

| Task | WSJF | Impact | Effort | Status | Result |
|------|------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Fix lint issue | 5.0 | 5 | 1 | ✅ | 30-second fix, CI green |
| CLI complexity reduction | 4.5 | 9 | 2 | ✅ | 78% complexity reduction |
| Starlette complexity reduction | 4.0 | 8 | 2 | ✅ | 67% complexity reduction |

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### **Before vs After**
```
BEFORE:
├── main() [B(9)] - 62 lines, complex conditional flows
├── _generate_output() [B(8)] - nested error handling
├── _validate_app_path() [B(8)] - mixed validation logic
└── StarlettePlugin._parse_route_call() [C(12)] - complex AST parsing

AFTER:
├── main() [A(2)] - 18 lines, clear sequential flow
├── _generate_output() [A(5)] - delegated complexity to helpers
├── _validate_app_path() [A(3)] - separated input validation
└── StarlettePlugin._parse_route_call() [A(4)] - focused responsibility
```

### **Design Principles Applied**
1. **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each function has one clear purpose
2. **Don't Repeat Yourself** - Extracted common path traversal checks
3. **Fail Fast** - Early returns reduce nesting
4. **Composition over Complexity** - Helper functions over monolithic implementations
